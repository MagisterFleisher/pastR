# pastR
rStudio plugin: makes life easier and prettier with find and replace.  It's R, but clean.

Let's face it.  R looks ugly.  It hurts your eyes.  And, it could use a couple modern features:

- Piping

--- Solution\: \|>

- replace the word "function" with \: /. because /. looks like the letter, lambda
 
That's not so hard.  Official R hasn't really changed in the last 20 years.  Some things need the tiniest changes.

## Goals

In makes you stretch all over the keyboard.  Coding is so much faster if your hands don't have to leave the home row.  So no replacement for %in% with #in#

Using the workman layout The home row has these accessable without moving ones hand:

]

[


}

{


<

>

/

\

|


'

"

~
`
, 

.

All the letters.  Numbers require moving ones hands.  So no numbers.


## token replacement so far:

./ because it's easy for me to type

\|\> because it's easy to type, fast to type, and makes code beautiful.  Have you seen Elixer code?


## Some things to ponder

-- something to mean purrr:flatten
-- something to mean %in%
-- integrate the commonly used parts of the data.table package so it feels like R.


## The name

pastR sounds like the Albanian word for clean
